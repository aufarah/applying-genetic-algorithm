# applying-genetic-algorithm
Applying genetic algorithm for certain case (finding minima, training neural network,etc)

Content:
1.  finding minima in single variable curve.py
2.  1 hidden layer with ReLu.py
    Training  1 hidden layer-neural net with genetic algorithm
3.  1 hidden layer with ReLu and Edotensei.py
    Same with file number 2, but with more advanced technique i called Edotensei (inspired from Naruto series: resurrection of the dead). In this technique, the old best individual from pas evolution (which means they all already dead) will be called again to perform evolution.
